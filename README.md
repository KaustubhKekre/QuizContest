### Description
A multiple choice based quiz contest game. Player can answer a maximum of 10 questions. Player has to go up the money ladder with the difficulty of questions increasing with each correct answer. If the player gives a wrong answer, he/she will get the amount associated with the last checkpoint. Players also have the option of quitting the game by taking home the money they have won. Players can make use of 3 lifelines, namely 50:50, double dip and audience poll, at any stage of the game. These lifelines can be used only once. 50:50 deletes 2 wrong options of the given 4 options, double dip allows the players to select 2 answers and audience poll give a graphical display of the number of people backing a particular option (it depends on the player whether to go with or against the audience poll).
